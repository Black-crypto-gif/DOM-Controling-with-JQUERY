# DOM-Controling-with-JQUERY
this just simple project contain all cheat sheet of all jquery commands.
This only a tutorial or maybe just a cheat sheet for query codes, it's beautiful framework and save a lot of times, don't get me wrong,
I love vanilla javascript but since the time is the essence we must use more faster techniques. Thanks
